sphinx_fc21_manuals Documentation
=================================

The Freeciv21 development community has an extensive documentation library based on Sphinx reStructuredText
(ReST) files and the Read The Docs (RTD) theme. You can find it at
[longturn docs](https://longturn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

The whole purpose of this python module is to take all of the game rulesets that Freeciv21 offers to players
and produce well formated, visually appealing, and easy to read documenation for those rulesets. The current
in-game help is a good start, but does not give all of the details of a ruleset and what all the varying
parameters actually stand for and how the settings of those values impacts gameplay. Good documentation
should enhance knowledge and help the community enjoy playing Freeciv21 and the custom Longturn specific
rulesets that we enjoy playing.
