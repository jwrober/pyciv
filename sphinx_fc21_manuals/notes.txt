TODO:
- Get buildings by tech to add to advance.rst
- Figure out best way to document the nations. They are duplicated across the rulesets.
- Figure out best way to document terrain. I'll bet there is a lot of overlap between the rulesets. Will need terrain specific sprites if we want to show it on the page.
- Document the governments.
- Gather effects and document them where they are "effected" and not as a big page of them
- See if we can get all the unit action enablers documented and associated with the appropriate unit
- Need a detailed look at the helptext across all rulesets. Many items need to be cleaned up to be rst friendly. Usage of consonants and other doco style are not being followed.
- Create a universal look up page to document what the requirement vector table columns mean. Link to it where needed.
- The current graphics for the techs are really crappy. Before we go and show a graphic for the tech advances, need to get that issue fixed first.
- Run through each of the rulesets one by one and see how many sphinx warnings come up and see about fixes.
- Document (with helptext) what the scenario capabilities are. See index-game.rst

FIXES:
- SPRITE: Ecclesiastical palace is a small wonder, but in buildings list
- SPRITE: Harbor image uses the en_GB form of harbour, needs to be renamed.
- SPRITE: The wonder mausoleum_of_halicarnassus sprite is referred to as simply mausoleum in most rulesets, causing an issue with image lookup
- SPRITE: srcaravel is sq_rig_caravel.png, needs to be renamed
- BLDG: Fix building flags (see airport in royale, or others that say "set()")
- UNIT: The unit obsoletes value isn't working. for example, cavalry obsoletes knights in a lot of rulesets. Another example is pikemen obsolete phalanx.
- UNIT: Some rulesets have the mobility bonus added to the name of the veteran level causing duplicated information in the


QUESTIONS:
- Do we have any rulesets that use the "convert" feature for units? Would be good to see if the code works there.
